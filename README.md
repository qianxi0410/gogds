# [WIP] GoGDS (Go Generics DataStructures)

Implementation of various data structures and algorithms in Go,
`but with Generics`.

You must be know [gods](https://github.com/emirpasic/gods),
A very useful go data structure library.

But it hasn't been updated for a long time.

And go introduced generics in version 1.18, so I plan to transform the gods library into a generic version.

Why do this?

Because it's fun and refreshes the knowledge in data structures.
Maybe someone in the community has done this, but building wheels is a personal interest
